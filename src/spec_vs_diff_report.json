No favicon PNG assets were added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`, and there is no evidence that `frontend/index.html` was verified or updated.

      "requirement": "Add the missing favicon image files to `frontend/public/assets/generated/` using the exact filenames referenced by `frontend/index.html` so the browser can successfully load them at runtime.",

      "reason": "`frontend/index.html` is not listed among modified files, and no changes show any verification/update of favicon `<link>` tags.",
