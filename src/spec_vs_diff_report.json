  "summary": "The diff does not add any favicon image assets under frontend/public/assets/generated. Only metadata/state files were modified, so the requested favicon fix (REQ-4/REQ-5) is not implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Add the missing favicon image files referenced by frontend/index.html under frontend/public/assets/generated so the browser can load and display the favicon.",
      "reason": "No new files were added; the diff explicitly shows \"Added: 0\" and no assets under frontend/public/assets/generated were created, so the required PNGs are still missing and would still 404.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: Added: 0 (no added files)",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (shows many files but no new favicon assets)"

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Ensure the generated favicon images visually match the app’s existing heart icon style (a centered pink heart on a white circular background) across all required favicon sizes.",
      "reason": "Because no favicon images were added/updated in the diff, there is no implementation evidence of the required heart-on-white-circle visuals at any size.",

        "File diff summary: Added: 0 (no image assets added)"

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks for REQ-4 and REQ-5 (adding missing favicon assets and ensuring their visuals). The diff changes project_state.json to include features and notes about other requirements not part of this request.",
