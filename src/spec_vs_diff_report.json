  "summary": "Diff updates the favicon generator to draw a white circle background with a pink heart and defines the expected PNG filenames, but it does not add the required generated PNG assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` nor update `frontend/index.html` link tags. An unrequested `frontend/public/favicon.ico` file was added, and project metadata/summary files were modified despite the request being limited to favicon assets/HTML alignment.",

      "reason": "The diff does not show any of the required PNG files being added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (only a `.ico` was added). There is also no evidence that old favicon assets were removed or that references were updated to ensure only the new set is used.",
