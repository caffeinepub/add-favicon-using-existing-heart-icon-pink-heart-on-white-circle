  "summary": "The diff adds a new runtime utility to programmatically generate/download heart favicon PNGs, but it does not add the required static favicon image files under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`, nor does it show any verification/updates to `frontend/index.html` link tags to ensure they resolve to existing assets. Several unrelated feature descriptions appear in `project_state.json` / `frontend-file-summaries.txt`, suggesting scope creep not requested for the favicon fix.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Add the missing favicon image files under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` using the exact filenames referenced by `frontend/index.html`.",
      "reason": "No favicon PNG assets are added under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` in the diff summary; only a TypeScript generator utility is added. Without the static files in `public`, runtime requests would still 404 in production builds.",
      "evidence": [
        "ADDED: frontend/src/lib/generate-favicons.ts (no public assets added)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Generate a consistent favicon image set that is a very simple pink heart on a transparent background, crisp and centered at each target size (16, 32, 180, 192, 512) with no additional background shape.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include exported PNG files to verify visual crispness/centering/transparent background. The added code draws a heart on a canvas and returns a data URL, but it does not place generated PNGs into `frontend/public/assets/generated/` as required.",
      "evidence": [
        "ADDED: frontend/src/lib/generate-favicons.ts (generates data URLs / downloads; no committed PNG outputs)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Verify `frontend/index.html` favicon `<link>` tags resolve to the generated assets and keep filenames/paths aligned with assets in `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (update HTML only if needed).",
      "reason": "No changes to `frontend/index.html` are shown in the diff summary, so there is no evidence that the favicon link `href`s were checked/updated to match actual files in `frontend/public/assets/generated/`.",
      "evidence": [
        "Diff summary shows no `frontend/index.html` modifications"
      ]

    {
      "description": "Programmatic favicon generation/download utility (`generateHeartFavicon`, `downloadFavicon`, `FAVICON_SIZES`) added to frontend source code.",
      "reason": "The request requires committing static generated images under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`, not adding runtime code to generate or download favicons in the browser.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/lib/generate-favicons.ts"

    },
    {
      "description": "Updates/feature tracking indicating additional app behavior changes (authentication flow, dashboards, trackers, backend changes) unrelated to favicon assets.",
      "reason": "Non-goal explicitly disallows adding unrelated features; the diff summary indicates broad changes via `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json` that are not part of the favicon-asset fix request (though the actual code changes are not shown here).",
